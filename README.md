# crossnetcode
This is a [WIP] mod for crosscode to allow networked multiplayer. This project will probably take anywhere from 1-3 years (from Decemeber 8th, 2022) before actual results start happening, due to the sheer size and scope of said project, but progress can be tracked here.

## Planned Features
crosscode-multiplayer is a modding framework that will allow for the development of multiplayer content in crosscode. The exact details are currently unknown but that is the intention.
- A Robust Client-Server Architecture that can hold up to 8 players per server
- Modding API for the creation of multiplayer elements
- Additions to the Map Editor for the creation of multiplayer specific maps and features
- A set of examples to showcase the framework
- detailed documentation and tutorials

## The Overall Plan
This is a pretty ambitous project which means having a plan and some design work done will help out immensely in the long run and hopefully will let me and any contributors avoid any pitfalls. I'm not sure how the licensing and stuff will work yet, so I'm not touching any of that yet. This is a huge project but it has milestones that can be obtained and the overall shape looks like this. (**NS** means not started, **NF** means not finished, and each entry will have links to more specific plans for each of them to follow)
