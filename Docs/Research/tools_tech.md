# Tools
This document is going to contain all the tech used in this project and why.

## Network
This section has any tech/tools related to networking tech
- [WebRTC](https://membrane.stream)
  - The backbone of how connection is actually going to work

## Tech Stack
this is related to any tools/tech used on the techstack
- [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org)/[Erlang](https://www.erlang.org)
  - this is the language that the server will be written in and I'm using it because I think it is suited for this kind of netcode in games. There are some cases of it being used, but it isn't hugely popular. If I need to change it I will.
- [C++](https://cplusplus.com)
  - Specifically Modern C++ is going to be used as the primary language for client side and game engine calculations
- [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
  - A Ui Framework for C++ for creating dev tools
- [ASIO](https://think-async.com/Asio/)
  - A UDP transport layer for C++
- [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org)
  - A graphics Library for rendering
- [ElixirScript](https://github.com/elixirscript/elixirscript)
  - an elixir library that interfaces Elixir and Javascript
- [Membrane](https://membrane.stream)
  - an elixir library to allow the use of WebRTC Data Channels

## Prototype tools
Any tool that is/was used in the protoyping phase will be included here
- [CC Hair Modifier](https://github.com/blobbeliblob/CC_hair_modifier)
  - This will be used to create different lea sprites to make inital protoypes clearer
